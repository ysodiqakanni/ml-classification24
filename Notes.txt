WITH SAMPLE DATASET rice_cameo and osmancik from ucirepo
- knn with k=4, metric minkowski
   insample = 93.2%
   outsample = 92.3%

- with svm linear, insample 92.8%, outsample 93.8%
   

- plot fit and predict wall clock times


* for ANN, try different epoch values. -> the number of times the model passes through all my data

KNN is:
-sensitive to noisy data, 
-poor performance with high dimension (too many features)
-good for small to medium size problems

SVM:
- good for high dimension
- good with noise
- good for small to medium instances but with many features

ANN:
- needs very large data. Can overfit with small dataset
